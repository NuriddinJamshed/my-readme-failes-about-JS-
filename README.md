## Conditions

Conditions in JavaScript are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

### Example:
```javascript
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else if (x === 5) {
  console.log("x is equal to 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than 5");
}
